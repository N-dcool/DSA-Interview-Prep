### üìÖ March 4, 2025 - DSA Solutions
#### Problem 1: Two Sum
**Approach:** Used HashMap for O(n) solution.
**Code:**
```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        hashmap = {}
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            diff = target - num
            if diff in hashmap:
                return [hashmap[diff], i]
            hashmap[num] = i
```
